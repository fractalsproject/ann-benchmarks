APU#1 stores the results for all of our benchmark testing on various datasets and algorithms. These files are in Braden's ann-benchmarks/old_results 

There is also a fresh set of results stored in ann-benchmarks/results from a glove-50-angular benchmark.

## deep1b
The deep1b branch of this repo contains code modified to support a benchmark of 5% of deep1b. Code works similar to normal but requires you predownload the full deep1b. 
See https://medium.com/gsi-technology/ann-benchmarks-a-data-scientists-journey-to-billion-scale-performance-db191f043a27 for notes on file converting. Once the files are converted and merged it works as normal ann-benchmarks.
